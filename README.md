<center><p> hi this is my funny poneytown account. i tend to just chill and ponywatch on here, if i ignore you it's not personal - i'm either shy or afk! i'm usually playing with partners or friends. some fictives in my system might come around and chill as well.

<p>

<center><p> my current fixations are mainly roblox related! i currently like pressure, forsaken, sewh, general old roblox (whether its the game itself or old myths/lore) and more. i'm also very autistic about technology as a whole lmao

<center><p> **minors please dni**, i'm usually on the 18+ servers for a reason. i don't give much of a fuck about discourse anymore but **i tend to hide proshippers and people who ick me out**, either through their convos or what their pony is portraying. i'm just here to chill, it's a horse game, who give a shit
